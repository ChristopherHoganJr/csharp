Data Structures
Inside of the RunExercise method of the Exercise class, create a dictionary with string keys and decimal values called "itemPrices".
Set the price for "cheese" to 5.99 and the price for  "carrots" to 2.99.
Don't forget to end your lines with semicolons (;), and put an "m" after the value you assign to your decimals.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Coding.Exercise
{
    public class Exercise
    {
        public void RunExercise()
        {
            //Write Your Code Here
            Dictionary<string, decimal> itemPrices = new Dictionary<string, decimal>(){
                {"cheese", 5.99m},
                {"carrots", 2.99m}
            };
            
            //Write You Code Above This Line
            Console.WriteLine(itemPrices["cheese"].GetType());
            Console.WriteLine(itemPrices["cheese"]);
            Console.WriteLine(itemPrices["carrots"]);
        }
    }
}
