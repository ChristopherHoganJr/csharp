Inside of the RunExercise method of the Exercise class declare 3 variables "myString", "myDecimal" and "myBoolean".
The types of those variables should be string, decimal, and bool respectively.
Don't forget to end your lines with semicolons (;), and put an "m" after the value you assign to your decimal.


{
    public class Exercise
    {
        public void RunExercise()
        {
            //Write Your Code Here
            string myString = "This is my string.";
            decimal myDecimal = 123m;
            bool myBoolean = true;
            
            //Write You Code Above This Line
            Console.WriteLine(myString.GetType());
            Console.WriteLine(myDecimal.GetType());
            Console.WriteLine(myBoolean.GetType());
        }
    }
